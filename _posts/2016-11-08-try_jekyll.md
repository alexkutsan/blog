Hi, I decided to create technical blog, where I will write interesting problems that I am face with. 
I fount out that github allows to host *dynamical* sites! I think that it is rely awesome!
It is rather difficult to create blog on static html pages. 
There fore good people create site generators that parce some simplified structure and 
creates static web pages. Jekyll is one of them.
It allows create site strucutre using YAML and write blog posts with Markdown

A lot of smart gust created a lot of awesome templates for Jekyll. http://jekyllthemes.org/ 
I like minimalizm, so I forked template from https://github.com/getmicah/blog 
After forking I chenged templte a bit. 
Main changes: 
- tags support 
- blog posts comments with https://disqus.com/ 


Also I *would* **like** `to test` ```some features``` _*of markdown*_ in this post :-)
And image inserting:

*Pretty kitty*

Also pice of code:
{% highlight C++ %} 
int main() {
  return 0;
}
{% endhighlight %}
